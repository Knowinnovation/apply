            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Human communities and economies are concentrated along the world’s coastlines. Yet ongoing changes in climate continue to drive complex interactions between geophysical and social-ecological systems that amplify environmental threats facing coastal communities and their economies. Such amplification also magnifies existing inequities in the hidden coast – non-oceanfront regions where rural, minority, and/or impoverished communities reside. Primary threats to coastal communities include inundation of coastal infrastructure by sea level rise and coastal storms, deteriorating coastal water quality, overexploitation of fisheries and increasing food insecurity, and past sustainability solutions with unintended consequences including exacerbation of social inequity and environmental injustice. The Coastal Sustainability workshop leverages nature-based solutions as a framework to explore and shape the co-development of convergent research that is stakeholder-driven, inclusive, and focused on implementation of sustainability solutions that promote clean, safe, smart, and equitable coastal communities. </h3>
            <p><strong>The event will be held online, and will take place XX 2021. &mdash;</strong></p>
            <p>Applicants must commit to participating for the entire duration of the series if selected as a meeting participant.</p>
            <p>There will also be some required prework and light background reading/viewing.</p>
            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p>Sustaining human coastal communities is a urgent societal priority. While this urgency is driven by complex challenges, it also opens new doors of opportunity to (1) move away from entrenched and outdated perspective on the relationship between people and nature and (2) co-develop solutions that are environmentally sound and socially equitable. Coastal Sustainability workshop participants will meet these challenges by embracing convergent research that integrates the expertise of geophysical, biological, cognitive and social scientists, and engineers, and fully co-develops strategies with diverse stakeholders and decision makers. The nature-based framework of the workshop will focus on four vertical (Aquaculture, Watershed Planning, Living Shorelines, Managed Retreat) and four horizontal (Stakeholder-Participation, Social & Cognitive Drivers, Technology, Finance) themes that create “nodes of opportunity” that sit within a landscape of uncertainty: in management practice, in scientific and societal understanding, and in cognition of threats and opportunities. Determining the basis of these uncertainties and overcoming it will be fundamentally important to identifying and optimizing sustainability solutions and their viability for implementation.
</p>
 
<p>A convergent approach is needed to overcome these challenges and make significant intellectual and societal advances. Such an approach could leverage existing programs that fund research related to Coastlines and its consequences. Through developing a coordinated effort, significant advances can be made. Collaborations between researchers in diverse biological fields and quantitative scientists (e.g. mathematicians, computer scientists, Earth scientists, and engineers) with relevant expertise could lead to better approaches to interrogate and predict wildfire behavior and ecological consequences using available data, in situ and remote sensing, and new experimental systems.</p>

<h3>The Workshop Series</h3>
            <p>We need to tailor this - here is placeholder text in case it is useful. This lab will bring together PI-level wildfire researchers working in a variety of fields including physiological, population and community, ecosystem and macrosystem ecology; evolutionary processes; systematics and biodiversity science; geomorphology/land surface processes; hydrology; biogeochemistry; computational and modeling sciences; engineering; atmospheric sciences; remote sensing; computer science; and those exploring the human dimensions of wildfire. Researchers working with cyberinfrastructure, with facilities such as NEON and NCAR, NASA satellites and campaigns, with research networks such as LTER, CZO, AON, Ameriflux, ForestGeo, etc. are welcome, as well as those working on education and outreach initiatives and workforce training development. Above all, innovation lab applicants should be interested in forming new collaborations and developing innovative approaches to address challenges associated with studying wildfire and its impacts. </p>
            <p>As an exercise in these nodal intersections, workshop participants will be asked to explicitly identify barriers and solutions from each of their perspectives. For example, issues of degree of acceptable uncertainty in predictions, and the spatial and temporal scales over which scientific data are made available, are expected to differ among stakeholder groups. Technical solutions like coastal aquaculture, living shorelines, and new methods for managing coastal wetlands can be derailed if stakeholders are not integrated into the decision process. A key aspect of promoting sustainable solutions is the communications strategy used to impart information and engage participation.

The Knowinnovation (KI) team will work with the PIs in the months leading up to the event to plan, design, and prepare for the workshop. This project coordination will be organized around a regular call and all information will be captured in a project management board on the Asana TM online platform. During these meetings the KI team will lead conversations around things like logistics, but more importantly the team will work to better articulate the goals of the workshop, define tangible outcomes of the workshop, determine the right participant mix to achieve these goals, and design the agenda and activities of the workshop.

Key features of the workshop will include interactive, co-development of ideas and promotion of diversity and inclusion across academic, industry, and stakeholder partners. Event design will focus on ideation, style of interaction, and specific outputs. KI promotes workshop formats where participants move around frequently across virtual rooms to ensure engagement with diverse and new perspectives that are driven by different kinds of stimulus. KI creates events that are participant-generated with ideas coming from the “front lines” of active members of the research, education, stakeholder and decision-making community. KI will work with the Organizing Committee and NSF to generate stimulating questions and mechanisms of output capture. A significant intention of KI’s interactive events is to build future collaborations, explore real ideas that people can move forward, promote community-building both during the event and after (e.g., establishing Slack channels and social media outlets that continue the engagement).

Although the exact format of the workshop continues to evolve dynamically during conversations between KI and the Organizing Committee, the current plan (Table 1) is to host a 3-day, virtual workshop in mid-May 2021. The first two days will be devoted to modules (100 minutes) focusing on the four vertical themes: Aquaculture & Living Shorelines (Day 1) and Managed Retreat & Watershed Planning (Day 2). Cross-cutting, horizontal themes will be integrated throughout each module activity. For each module, we will provide a pre-workshop, pre-recorded keynote address that is meant to Inspire a Listening and Ideation session (30 minutes) during the workshop. The Listening and Ideation session (40 minutes) will be followed by multiple breakout sessions mean to facilitate deeper dives on key topics. Workshop participants will then reconvene for a Synthesis session (30 minutes). An overarching Integration and Synthesis session led by the Organizing Committee will take place on Day 3. This session will be focused on outputs from Days 1 and 2 with the goal of building the foundation for the Workshop Report.

Both the Coastal Sustainability Institute and KI are dedicated to ensuring that broad constituencies have a voice at our workshop, with particular emphasis on stakeholders from systemically marginalized groups. Historically, efforts to promote coastal sustainability through nature-based solutions have primarily included individuals with privileged opportunity and educational background, with significant capital investment in businesses or property vulnerable to climate change, and/or with occupational incentives for dedicating their time (Jurjonas et al. 2020). We will actively recruit individuals who work closely with stakeholders from systemically marginalized communities, including municipal individuals responsible for housing, water, waste management, and economic development (Shi et al. 2016). We will also work closely with community and social justice advocacy groups, and we will provide participant support costs to facilitate their participation.




            <h3>Who Should Apply??</h3>
            <p>We should update this if we want an application. this is place holder text from a recent workshop: We encourage researchers and educators at the PI-level with diverse expertise across the continuum of wildfire research: biology (molecular to global scale), engineering, Earth science, physical science, social science, and computer science to consider how your experience could help to fundamentally transform our understanding of how strategic and convergent research could improve our understanding of how wildfires and living systems interact and forecast these dynamics in a warming world.</p>

<p>Irrespective of expertise, we are most interested in new, innovative ideas and original thinking that arise from new collaborations between people of diverse backgrounds and varying experience.</p>

<p>Approximately XX applicants will be selected to participate on the basis of the interests, expertise, and other characteristics solicited in the application. Most participants are expected to be academic faculty, from early career to senior investigators. Original thinkers from outside academia are also encouraged to apply. When selecting participants, consideration will be given to balance across a range of diverse disciplinary experience and expertise. All participants should be willing to engage in frank discussion and assessment of ideas in a collegial and professional fashion. To facilitate open sharing, all meeting discussions will be considered a private communication and not to be shared outside of the meeting, unless approved by the contributor. </p>
<p> At this time there are no funding opportunities associated with this lab, but opportunities for submission of project proposals across NSF and other federal agencies will be highlighted during the lab. This would be cool - let's ask Lara.

            <h3>Meeting Outcomes</h3>
            <p>This convergence accelerator workshop will focus on fundamental and translational science and engineering that collaborates with stakeholders to co-develop knowledge, solutions and tools. Recognizing that both scientific and societal barriers prevent their full realization, the workshop will leverage nature-based solutions as an overarching framework that seeks to promote convergence across four vertical and four horizontal themes (Figure 1). The verticals represent categories of nature-based solutions and the horizontals represent cross-cutting approaches needed to fully implement the verticals. The intersection of each of these horizontal and vertical themes – the nodes – represent pockets of opportunity amidst uncertainty in management approaches, the science driving them, and the stakeholder communities that will ultimately be impacted by potential sustainability solutions. We will do a deep dive with workshop participants to identify scientific priorities that include reversing and preventing the causes of impaired water quality (e.g., harmful algal blooms and hypoxia) and improving coastal infrastructure including new approaches to cope with threats posed by sea level rise and coastal storm surge. We also will focus on barriers to full realization by integrating the cognitive and social sciences to determine how human attitudes, beliefs, and preferences dictate the viability of sustainability solutions. A key point of emphasis will be promotion of equitable outcomes while optimizing the various trade-offs that exist between economic, social-ecological, geophysical drivers and their interaction with human attitudes, beliefs and preferences. Below we summarize the key themes and the primary people leading them.
