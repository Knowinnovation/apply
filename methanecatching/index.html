            <h2>We want to accelerate the ways in which we capture methane or reduce methane emissions.</h2>
            <p>We know that methane impacts on climate change faster and with greater severity than CO2. If we are to achieve global targets then we must tackle methane capture, or reduce emissions, with the same or greater focus than we are currently applying to CO2. </p><p>We are now beyond the point where we need to understand the problem better and we want to move to action. We acknowledge that this is not just a problem for science - any solution will require inter-disciplinary collaboration. That is why we are bringing together a group of scientists, policy-makers, social scientists, economists and engineers to seek solutions and initiate real projects that will make a difference.</p><p>Would you like to be part of this programme - to work with colleagues across disciplines to make a real, practical difference to global warming?</p>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>The MIT Methane Network has been established to drive down atmospheric methane levels by inventing new technologies, business models, and policy solutions in the framework of equity and social justice. Guided by an understanding of Earth processes and Industrial activities, we seek to capture and convert methane to value-added or reduced-warming materials and to reduce methane emissions. We will create policy test beds to quantify impact of technologies and policies and chart a path to a decarbonized, more equitable future. Our approach integrates social, economic, and environmental metrics to reduce climate change in the near term.</p><p>Atmospheric methane reduction is difficult because: (1) there is no single dominant source of methane to the atmosphere, (2) most sources are very dilute and distributed, and (3) methane is both hard to capture and hard to react.</p><p>This means that solutions have to be highly integrated and collaborative. This cannot be done just by scientists or just by policy makers - it needs concerted, collaborative action</p>
        
<h3>About the Workshops</h3>
<p>Our goal is to create the opportunity for individual scientists, policy-makers, social scientists, economists and engineers to develop collaborative, interdisciplinary projects that will have a life of their own. We have divided the workshops into two. The first <b>(on April 7 and 8)</b> will focus on articulating the challenge. We are particularly interested in hearing from engineers and technicians who are working in this field.</p><p>The second workshop <b>(on May 5 and 6)</b> will focus on developing solutions that can be implemented over the next 15 years. We are particularly interested in working with social scientists, policy makers and conomists.</p><p>The workshops will run virtually over two half days and will be immersive, collaborative and stimulating.</p>


            <h3>Participation</h3>
            <p>We encourage scientists, policy-makers, social scientists, economists and engineers to participate and contribute to the discussion with a view to developing collaborative projects.</p>
            <p>We respect your time and want to make best use of that precious resource. Ideally, we would like you to partcipate in both workshops - they will build on each other. If you can only attend one, then the first one will focus on Articulating the Challenge and might best suit engineers and technicians already working in this space. The second workshop will focus on develoing collaborative solutions. Register using the button below so that we can plan effectively.</p>

            <p>We do not know what the precise topics are likely to be for the second workshops in May - that is to be guided by your discussions at the first workshop in April. We invite you to hold all 4 dates in your calendar if possible.</p>
