            <h3>Workshop 1</h3>
            <h4>12-4pm, April 4th, 6th, & 8th, 2022</h4>
            <p>Open to All. These three sessions will build on each other to clarify this unique opportunity, hear provocation from outside exemplars, and generate ideas for funding opportunity concepts. Ideally, you would be able to come to all three. You can expect to hear outside perspectives, interact in small groups to generate ideas, and dig into possible future states. All are welcome to attend and if you have limited time, this series is best suited for people who like to explore a vision, gather data, and generate ideas. </p>
            <hr>

            <h3>Workshop 2</h3>
            <h4>12-4pm, April 20th, 2022</h4>
            <p>Open to All. Participants will listen in to presentations from stewards from workshop 1 present their early thinking to the community. All participants will be asked to give feedback on these early thoughts. Space will be made for new ideas to emerge and be captured. This one-part workshop is an excellent opportunity to listen in early to emerging thoughts and help to connect and catalyze these ideas with perspectives from around NSF. This workshop is ideal for anyone interested in helping to elevate and provide constructive feedback on emerging insights and has very limited time. </p>

            <h3>Workshop 3</h3>
            <h4>12-4pm, April 25th & 27th, 2022</h4>
            <p>A smaller group of participants will incorporate feedback from the community, refine thinking and prepare for the next round of idea development. Participants will be either nominated by their directorate or identified during open workshops as wildcard champions of ideas moving forward. If you are interested in attending this workshop please contact..... </p>
            <hr>

            <h3>Workshop 4</h3>
            <h4>12-4pm May 2nd, 4th & 6th, 2022</h4>
            <p>These workshops will be a smaller group of participants and will serve to synthesize ideas and further develop them in preparation for the implementation round.  Participants will be either nominated by their directorate or identified during open workshops as wildcard champions of ideas moving forward. If you are interested in attending this workshop please contact..... </p>
            <hr>

            <h3>Workshop 5</h3>
            <h4>12-4pm, May 9th & 11th, 2022</h4>
            <p>Open to All. These sessions will serve to bridge gaps. We will spend time further developing and refining the opportunity concepts. Groups may find themselves assessing the reality of these concepts with questions like, if these concepts were to be utilized, what would it cost, what would have to change. This workshop is best for people who can bring a constructive 'reality check' to the concepts, and offer insights into how they may be taken forward.</p>

            <h3>Workshop 6</h3>
            <h4>12-4pm May 16th & 18th, 2022</h4>
            <p>These workshops will be a smaller group of participants and will serve to synthesize ideas and further develop them using the feedback given from open sessions.  Participants will be either nominated by their directorate or identified during open workshops as wildcard champions of ideas moving forward. If you are interested in attending this workshop please contact..... </p>
            <hr>

            <h3>Workshop 7</h3>
            <h4>12-4pm, May 23rd & 25th</h4>
            <p>Open to All. For those that have given feedback along the way and anyone interested in hearing the output and lending knowledge and advice. Stewards will rotate through small groups to talk through their prototypes. Participants will give guidance and feedback such as what types of scientific challenges would they be excited to explore with this prototype? What other challenges or barriers might they face if trying to implement? Stewards will then finalize their prototypes for the NSF community. If you have not had a chance to join a session yet, this would be a great opportunity to lend your knowledge and advice. </p>
