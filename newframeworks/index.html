            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>NSF is creatively exploring HOW we fund science.  This series of workshops are designed to produce novel-to-NSF funding frameworks that support science, engineering, and education.  NSF is exploring research space that requires a conceptual switch; NSF currently support the “pursuit of basic scientific research that could benefit society”, but in the future NSF may want to “Benefit society through the pursuit of basic scientific research that allows X in Y years.”   </p>
<p>With that conceptual switch in mind, how would a funding framework look if NSF defined an end state that has specific societal benefits? How might we support research that would get us to a specified end state in a specific timeframe?  If NSF knows the desired societal impacts, and has a timeline for reaching them, how do we fund the intellectual merit to get there?  </p>
<p>These workshops are designed to facilitate out of the box thinking (i.e. imagine no budget limitation and no PAPPG!).  The workshops are scientifically agnostic because we are interested in the how and not the what of funding frameworks.  This opportunity is open to ALL NSF staff, regardless of type of position.  In particular, science assistants, program support staff, grants management specialists and fellows are encouraged to attend, and all ideas are welcome. We need a diversity of participants from across NSF!  Attend a single workshop or attend multiple workshops, there is an opportunity for ideas and feedback from all to be heard!</p>

            <h3>Workshop 1</h3>
            <h4>12-4pm, April 4th, 6th, & 8th, 2022</h4>
            <p>Open to All. These three sessions will build on each other to clarify this unique opportunity, hear provocation from outside exemplars, and generate ideas for funding opportunity concepts. Ideally, you would be able to come to all three. You can expect to hear outside perspectives, interact in small groups to generate ideas, and dig into possible future states. All are welcome to attend and if you have limited time, this series is best suited for people who like to explore a vision, gather data, and generate ideas. </p>
            <hr>

            <h3>Workshop 2</h3>
            <h4>12-4pm, April 20th, 2022</h4>
            <p>Open to All. Participants will listen in to presentations from stewards from workshop 1 present their early thinking to the community. All participants will be asked to give feedback on these early thoughts. Space will be made for new ideas to emerge and be captured. This one-part workshop is an excellent opportunity to listen in early to emerging thoughts and help to connect and catalyze these ideas with perspectives from around NSF. This workshop is ideal for anyone interested in helping to elevate and provide constructive feedback on emerging insights and has very limited time. </p>
            <hr>

            <h3>Workshop 3</h3>
            <h4>12-4pm, April 25th & 27th, 2022</h4>
            <p>If you are interested in attending this workshop, you must attend Workshop 1 and/or 2 and be willing to champion ideas and work collaboratively to evolve these ideas to the next stage.”  For workshop 6, “If you are interested in attending this workshop, you must attend Workshop 5 and be willing to work collaboratively to create prototypes that will be presented to senior managers and other NSF staff interested in the outcomes of the workshops.</p>
            <hr>

            <h3>Workshop 4</h3>
            <h4>12-4pm May 2nd, 4th & 6th, 2022</h4>
            <p>If you are interested in attending this workshop, you must attend Workshop 1 and/or 2 and be willing to champion ideas and work collaboratively to evolve these ideas to the next stage.”  For workshop 6, “If you are interested in attending this workshop, you must attend Workshop 5 and be willing to work collaboratively to create prototypes that will be presented to senior managers and other NSF staff interested in the outcomes of the workshops.</p>
            <hr>

            <h3>Workshop 5</h3>
            <h4>12-4pm, May 9th & 11th, 2022</h4>
            <p>Open to All. These sessions will serve to bridge gaps. We will spend time further developing and refining the opportunity concepts. Groups may find themselves assessing the reality of these concepts with questions like, if these concepts were to be utilized, what would it cost, what would have to change. This workshop is best for people who can bring a constructive 'reality check' to the concepts, and offer insights into how they may be taken forward.</p>
            <hr>

            <h3>Workshop 6</h3>
            <h4>12-4pm May 16th & 18th, 2022</h4>
            <p>These workshops will be a smaller group of participants and will serve to synthesize ideas and further develop them using the feedback given from open sessions.  Participants will be either nominated by their directorate or identified during open workshops as wildcard champions of ideas moving forward. </p>
            <hr>

            <h3>Workshop 7</h3>
            <h4>12-4pm, May 23rd & 25th</h4>
            <p>Open to All. For those that have given feedback along the way and anyone interested in hearing the output and lending knowledge and advice. Stewards will rotate through small groups to talk through their prototypes. Participants will give guidance and feedback such as what types of scientific challenges would they be excited to explore with this prototype? What other challenges or barriers might they face if trying to implement? Stewards will then finalize their prototypes for the NSF community. If you have not had a chance to join a session yet, this would be a great opportunity to lend your knowledge and advice. </p>
