            <h2>A NSF Sponsored Convergence Accelerator Workshop</h2>
            
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>There are more than one billion PWDs in the world who constitute a source of talent for employment towards the development and offering of products and services [1]. Yet, the labor market participation rate of PWD is significantly lower than persons without disabilities. This underrepresentation is not often reflected in official statistics as many PWD are not even officially registered as unemployed. Data from eight regions across the world shows that only 36% of PWD of working age are employed whereas this figure is 60% for those without disabilities [2]. This report further shows that PWDs are more likely to be in a vulnerable employment situation and paid less, with women with disabilities often in a worse position than their male counterparts. The challenges faced by the disabled population in contributing equally in our society has implications not only to our economies, but also human rights, equality, equity, and diversity.</p>

<p>The statistics for the U.S. alone are not encouraging either. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) [3] 61 million adults in the United States (about 26% of 1 in 4 people) live with some kind of disability. 13.7% of adults have a disability in mobility (ex. walking, climbing stairs), 10.8% in cognition (ex. concentrating, making decisions and remembering), 6.8% in independent living (ex. doing errands alone), 5.9% in hearing (ex. deafness or serious difficulty hearing), 4.6% in vision (ex. blindness or serious difficulty seeing), and 3.7% in self care (ex. difficulty in dressing or bathing). Only 29% of working age Americans (aged 16 to 64) with disabilities are employed vs. 75% of Americans without disabilities. The Unemployment rate for persons with disabilities is 2 times more than that of those without disabilities.</p>

<p>There are many challenges currently in the inclusion of PWD to the workforce. These can be categorized into the following:</p>
<ul><li>Lack of an enabling environment: The potential challenges that can be placed in this category comprises accessibility barriers in transportation, built environments, products and services. It can also include inadequate or improper unemployment benefit programs, disability support services, affirmative action or quotas, vocational training and rehabilitation programs.</li>
<li>Employers: The potential challenges that can be placed in this category comprises the general lack of awareness or confidence by employers to hire and retain PWD or provide professional development, and adequate workplace accommodations. It can also include inaccessible work premises and work tools, including Information and Communication Technologies (ICT).</li>
<li>Workforce development organizations: The challenges placed in this category primarily revolve around the lack of attention by trade unions, employer and professional associations, and local workforce development organizations to the needs of PWD who are already employed or are seeking to enter the workforce.
Society: This category comprises the challenges posed by stigma and stereotypes surrounding PWD and their capabilities, and the increased exposure to harassment and violence.</li>

<p>In spite of the many challenges facing PWD in work scenarios, there are many encouraging developments in terms of policies and practices. The advantages of disability inclusion are being recognized by both the public and private sectors and are being touted as the business case for disability inclusion. These cases consider PWD in the two following roles:</p>

<ul><li><strong>PWD as employees</strong>: It has been shown that disability inclusion has a positive impact on business performance. PWD have traditionally shown a willingness to experiment in order to adapt to the world around them and develop valuable skills and traits such as problem-solving, agility, forethought, innovative thinking and perseverance [4]. Studies show that PWD make workplaces more inclusive and stigma-free environments that are better for everyone [4]. Additionally, companies employing PWD are above average in terms of profitability and value creation [5]. Moreover, the turnover rate among PWD employees was 48% less than for persons without disabilities, and general staff turnover rate can be reduced by up to 30% by adding PWD in the workforce [6]. Employing PWD can also bring improved reputations to employers [7] and possibly negative impacts to the reputation of those who do not [8].</li>
<li><strong>PWD as consumers</strong>: In an increasingly complex and diverse world, innovative products, services, and environments that are accessible to all are not just desirable, but they also offer a competitive advantage. Apart from the ability to reach one billion people with disabilities, their friends, family, and the general aging population presents additional opportunities to provide products and services [9].</li></ul></p>


<h3>An Opportune Time</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of the century, due to the increasing cooperation and interconnection between people and technology, there has been a transformation in not only the means of production, but also the supply and demand of products and services. Sometimes called the Fourth Industrial Revolution, this transformation represents a series of significant shifts in the way economic, political, and social value is being created, exchanged, and distributed. A major reason for these shifts are new technologies, namely artificial intelligence, digitalization and blockchains enabled by high-speed communication networks. These technological developments will also shape the future of work. The technological revolution, which comprises areas such as, but not limited to, artificial intelligence, digitalization, automation, robotics, biometrics and big data is already causing major changes to the labor markets. These developments will continue to shape the jobs of tomorrow and will require very different skill sets than those that exist today. The future of work will also be impacted by cultural changes. The consequences of the ongoing technological transformation are unclear, but without proper attention, issues such as the rise in inequality will increasingly impact disadvantaged populations that include PWD. It is essential at this time to identify the challenges and opportunities provided by this transformation and prepare for a more inclusive society. With adequate attention, preparation, and tools, the technological transformation can offer PWDs improved chances of being part of the workforce of tomorrow.

<h3>The Workshop Sessions</h3>
           <ul><li>Session I: May 20, 12 - 4 PM</li>
<li>Session II: May 25, 12 - 4 PM</li>
<li>Session III: May 28, 12 - 4 PM</li>

</p>
           
<h3>Meeting Outcomes</h3>
<p>The proposed workshop theme requires various disabilities, various rehabilitative and recuperative approaches, various organizations that serve the needs of PWD or provide opportunities, and various disciplines that need to integratively solve a part or the whole challenge, to come together. Thus, the need for convergence is clear. Disability inclusion in workplaces through technology is also clearly an use-inspired research area. The assistive technologies and tools that can be created in an accelerated fashion can make an immediate impact on a population that desperately needs such interventions to be part of the workforce for the greater benefit of society. The technology exists, the knowledge of what needs to be done exists; what is needed is a concerted effort to bring diverse stakeholders together to create a research agenda that, if pursued by various teams with adequate funding, can lead to real solutions that can be put to use immediately.</p>
