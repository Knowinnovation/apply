<dl>
<dt>I am currently a Postdoc or will be joining an institution in the Fall as an Assistant Professor.  Am I eligible to I attend the Workshop?</dt>

<dd>No, only current junior faculty who are eligible per the NSF CAREER solicitation are eligible for the 2022 NSF ENG CAREER Workshop. </dd>

<dt>I am unable to attend the last session on the first day. Is that ok?</dt>

<dd>Participants are welcome to attend the Day 1 and 3 General Sessions as their schedules permit.  Participants selected to participate in the Mock Panel Session on Day 2 are asked to be available to participate in the entire Session.</dd>

<dt>Is the Workshop free?</dt>

<dd>Participants selected to take part in the Mock Panel session will pay a $100 fee. Participants attending just the General Sessions do not have to pay any fees.</dd>

<dt>Will the sessions be recorded and distributed afterwards?</dt>

<dd>The Day 1 and 3 General Sessions will be recorded and available on the 2022 NSF ENG CAREER Workshop website.  For privacy reasons the Mock Panel session will not be recorded.</dd>

<dt>What time are the Sessions?</dt>

<dd>All Session times are Eastern Daylight Time (EDT).  Please see the draft agenda here for additional details.</dd>

<dt>How many junior faculty are anticipated to “virtually” attend the Workshop?</dt>

<dd>In previous years over 800 junior faculty members have attended the General Sessions.  Due to staffing, the Mock Panel Session is limited to 300 junior faculty members.</dd>

<dt>I’ve been selected to attend the Mock Panel Session on Day 2.  Can I also attend the Day 1 and 3 General Sessions?</dt>

<dd>Yes.  Mock Panel participants may attend Day 1-3 Workshop Sessions.  However, General Session attendees may attend ONLY the Day 1 and 3 General Sessions.</dd>

<dt>How do I apply for the Mock Panel?</dt>

<dd>There’s no need to submit additional material to “apply” for the Mock Panel.   Mock Panel participants will be selected from the general applicant pool. Selection criteria include:  a) NSF Biosketch and applicability of research area(s) to the Directorate for Engineering, b) timeliness and completeness of the application, and c) preference given to those who have not previously attended an NSF ENG CAREER workshop. Please review the application page for further information.</dd>

<dt>Will the Mock Panel review my NSF CAREER proposal?</dt>

<dd>The Mock Panel will review four (4) previously vetted NSF CAREER proposals. The Mock panel participants will serve as reviewers/panelists in the Mock Panel Session. These proposals were submitted to NSF previously and have been awarded or declined.  For privacy reasons, the PI names and institutions associated with the proposals will be redacted.</dd>

<dt>What is the Mock Panel procedure?</dt>

<dd>Prior to the meeting, Mock Panel participants are required to read ALL four Mock Panel proposals and write individual written reviews for each proposal. At the Mock Panel Session, for each proposal, each reviewer assigned to discuss the proposal will be asked to provide a brief (1-2 minute) summary of the proposal followed by his/her critique. The panel will then begin the discussion of the proposal.</dd>

<dt>I’ve been selected as a Mock Panel participant, but none of the proposals to be reviewed are relevant to my research or area of expertise?</dt>

<dd>Panelists are requested to comment on how well the proposal addresses the solicitation guidelines.  As Mock Panel participants, it is a best practice to spend less time on summarizing the actual science/engineering concepts presented in the proposal and more time on review/critique of how well the intellectual merits,  broader impacts and the integration of research and education are detailed and presented.</dd>

<dt>I’ve been asked to pay $100 for the Mock Panel Session.  Why is this necessary if the session is virtual?</dt>

<dd>The Mock Panel fees are required to offset the administrative support necessary for the success of the Mock Panel Sessions.</dd>
