            <h2>Use Cases For The Open Knowledge Network</h2>
            <p>Over the last four months, interdisciplinary groups have come together to explore potential use cases of an Open Knowledge Network as a way of illustrating its potential impact. Let's explore those use cases...</p>

              <p>An OKN could enable us to have near-real time visibility into supply chain flows for strategic commodities and goods, enabling a variety of user groups to collectively evaluate the health of their industry, inclusing achieving supply chain resilience.</p>

              <p>The US has more incarcerated people than any nation, many of whom remain unemployed, end up homeless, or worse. If we could collect, aggregate, and harmonize data across the subsystems comprising the justice system we could improve the way it works, and learn how different individuals move through the system at large.</p>

              <p>Today, we have no scalable method to connect understanding of food system relevant data investments across federal departments and agencies beyond interagency working group person-to-person communication. A food and climate open knowledge network (OKN) has the potential to vastly scale up our understanding of what is known about federal investments, which is key to supporting our interagency efforts and in meeting White House all-of-government priorities.</p>

              <p>We propose building a multi-faceted decision-support system to deliver coherent climate data for local community residents and decision makers to manage community infrastructure, health, equity, biodiversity, resilience, and so forth. To deliver a complete support package for local change initiatives, we propose to augment this software system with a connected ecosystem of data providers and experts, enabling collaborative communications between cross-sector groups.</p>

              <p>We propose an OKN of real-time data tracking homelessness, available housing, usage of shelter and social services, and related funding and programs. This will help city and community leaders to house every citizen and prevent future homelessness, with visibility into how their city is doing, and the dynamic flows maintaining that equilibrium.</p>

              <p>We propose building an electronic consent service to be used as a common mechanism to manage privacy preferences and consent assertions for protection of personal and/or sensitive information that is requested to be shared between ontology-driven systems.  This service will achieve improved availability and appropriate protection of sensitive information (which may otherwise be withheld due to law, regulation, policy, procedure, or simply uncertainty by those holding that information).</p>

              <p>We propose building a Data Integration and Prediction OKN Model primarily based on federal, state, and local data already being collected for decision-makers at the federal, state, and local levels and their constituents to achieve better, data-based governance decisions by developing a strategic decision-support tool which (a) provides decision-makers data-driven insight  and (b) predicts the range of expected impacts for any given decision.</p>

              <p>We propose integrating disparate datasets, data sources and knowledge graphs from different organizations to coordinate policy development and planning. Not constrained to a single domain, this will provide horizontal integration to provide greater insight within medicine, energy policy, etc. (i.e. not constrained to a single stove-piped domain)</p>

              <p>We propose developing a multi-faceted decision support tool that would allow DOE, utilities and local communities/stakeholders to understand the current risk to the grid, the relationship between communities and the grid system from the perspective of energy justice and burden, identify potential places for renewables to address the supply and demand.</p>

              <p>This OKN Use Case will act as an entry point to the rest of the OKN, by providing a unified, foundational learning platform. The different aspects and initiatives of the OKN will use a wide variety of different tools and technologies, many of which will leverage fundamental concepts that are likely new to many of those involved. These concepts; the tools that are built on top of them; the frameworks they employ or comprise; and the use cases that they solve will all need to be described in an understandable and approachable manner, so that the OKN may best serve the public good and facilitate true public access.</p>

              </header>
              <p>We propose creating an information commons that takes advantage of existing OKN efforts that address specific risks (e.g., floods (UFOKN), fires (KnowWhereGraph), space weather and terrestrial weather storms (CHESS)) and integrative tools (the COVID Information Commons, EarthCube and Big Data Hubs) to bring them together to understand the compounding effects of risks and give context and create situational awareness to any given risk.</p>

              <p>We propose the development of an open knowledge network that enumerates and characterizes contemporary and historical sources of bias/gaps and how they relate to scientific funding streams and outcomes with the goal of identifying overlooked research approaches and  facilitating more equitable and robust scientific funding allocation that takes into consideration, and perhaps addresses historical, disciplinary, and technological biases of scientific funders.</p>
