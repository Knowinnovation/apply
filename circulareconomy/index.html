            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Circular economy (CE) aims to decouple economic growth from resource consumption by cycling products and materials back into production, either by returning materials to generate new products, or by releasing benign substances to the environment through degradation. A truly circular economy keeps material in continuous use by design. The overall adoption of CE principles has been incremental at best – especially in the US.  To achieve – or even begin to achieve – a circular economy, a convergent research approach needs to be employed as a multitude of disciplines -- from material science, chemistry, biology, engineering, business, economics, social sciences, and behavioral sciences need to work in concert for circularity.  Thus, we are inviting you to be a part of this journey. By deeply integrating these diverse disciplines, we can begin to work on tackling the complex challenges that currently inhibit the growth of the circular economy today.</p>
        <p>The US lags far behind in CE design research and policy formulation in comparison with our UK, EU, and Asian colleagues, and our plan is to include a retrospective/lessons learned session from policy makers to inform the researcher community. A key outcome would be to learn where current policies create barriers to wider implementation of circular concepts.  It is noteworthy that the emerging CE-based studies resemble many of the same conversations that occurred in the biomass conversion community starting in the early 2000s. Given the successes and failures of the biofuels and bioproducts community, we propose to include some aspects of learning from this community related to scale-up, development of rigorous standards and protocols to enable comparisons of various design and reuse strategies, and the need for early and comprehensive analyses for sustainability and supply chains.
 </p>
            <h3>Date and Location</h3>
            <p><strong>The event will be held online from 12:00- 3:00 PM EST, and will take place on September 18th, 24th and 30th</strong></p>
            <p>Ideally you will be able to attend all three sessions; however, if you are unable to do so, the RSVP form allows you to select which sessions you can attend.  We will also be recording sessions.</p>
            <p>There will also be some required prework and light background reading/viewing.</p>
            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p>put some text in here about the big challenge </p>
            <p> Additional paragraph if you want/need it</p>
            <h3>Who Should Register to Attend</h3>
            <p>Our stakeholder community includes the research/academic community, government, industry, non-profits, foundations, and international partners; this list is not inclusive but will be further developed as the workshop nears. We have communicated with several key personnel from the National Science Foundation, including Linda Molnar to obtain strategic and tactical information on the Convergence Accelerator program, Keith Chanon to garner his international expertise, Bruce Hamilton for his expertise on sustainable engineering and programmatic questions, and Christy Payne for her extensive work with plastics and the recent EFRI efforts. We have also discussed this with colleagues from the US Department of Energy, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), including Dr. Nichole Fitzgerald, who manages the DOE-funded BOTTLE Consortium. She has noted that DOE could bring further support to, and stakeholder engagement in, the proposed workshop.</p>
 
<p>We will work to strike a balance between breadth and depth, drawing on recommendations from the Planning Committee. A key point of the workshop is to understand how all of these group work together and eventually converge on solutions.</p>
