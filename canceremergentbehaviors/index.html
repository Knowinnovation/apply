            <h2>Accepting Applications: Modeling Emergent Cellular Behaviors in Cancer 2021 Virtual Innovation Lab</h2>

            <h4>Join our virutal workshop to develop novel cross-disciplinary collaborations!</h4>
            <p><strong>Applications are due December 1st 2020 (Midnight Pacific Time). Apply Today!</strong></p>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Recent large-scale single-cell atlasing efforts have led to rich catalogues of cell types within tumors, but use of these data to predict emergent aggregate behaviors in cancer has lagged behind. The goal of the Modeling Emergent Cellular Behaviors in Cancer Innovation Lab is to generate creative strategies and new research collaborations aimed at improving understanding, prediction, and validation of cell-cell communication strategies and the aggregate behavior of cell ensembles in cancerous tissues. Improved modeling of these behaviors may uncover general biological principles underlying tissue organization and tumor formation. This Innovation Lab is intended to bring together experts in computational, systems and cancer biology to develop a roadmap for the direction of this emerging research area. It is anticipated that this Innovation Lab will lead to interdisciplinary pilot projects that advance scientific questions related to dynamic cell-cell communication and emergent cellular behaviors. In addition to research projects, participants will have the opportunity to contribute to a white paper aimed at shaping the direction of this emerging research area. Interdisciplinary pilot projects that advance scientific questions related to dynamic cell-cell communication and emergent cellular behaviors. In addition to research projects, participants will have the opportunity to contribute to a white paper aimed at shaping the direction of this emerging research area.</h3>
            <p><strong>The event will be held online, and will take place on insert date&mdash;</strong></p>
            <p>Applicants must commit to participating for the entire duration of the Innovation Lab if selected as a meeting participant.</p>
            <p>There will also be some required prework and light background reading/viewing.</p>
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This Innovation Lab will bring together PI-level cancer researchers and clinician scientists, cell and developmental biologists, systems biologists, engineers, physical scientists, and computer scientists interested in forming new collaborations and developing innovative approaches to address challenges associated with studying emergent population behavior in cancer using single-cell resolution measurements. The availability of large-scale high-resolution data could facilitate research to uncover basic biological principles underlying tissue function and dysfunction. Achieving the potential of single cell measurements to understand dynamic and context dependent behavior will necessitate computational approaches to identify a tractable set of physiologically realistic testable hypotheses, integration of single-cell data modalities, and experimental systems to test these hypotheses.</p>
<p>
Important approaches to improve quantification and prediction of emergent cellular behaviors include machine learning methods to interrogate diverse cell and tissue phenotypes, in vitro models capable of recapitulating in vivo tumor behaviors and tumor-stromal interactions, agent-based or ODE models of tumor cell interactions, and developmental frameworks applied to the tumor microenvironment. Collaborations between researchers in diverse biological fields with quantitative scientists (e.g. mathematicians, computer scientists, and engineers) with relevant expertise could lead to better approaches to interrogate emergent cellular behaviors using available data and new experimental systems. </p>
<p>
At the Innovation Lab, interdisciplinary teams will work together to ideate and develop a roadmap for how to tackle selected challenges in this field. Through the course of the five days, teams will form, pitch and refine plans (based on input from the mentors) for interdisciplinary pilot projects that advance scientific questions related to dynamic cell-cell communication and emergent cellular behaviors. In addition to research projects, participants and mentors will have the opportunity to contribute to a white paper aimed at shaping the direction of this emerging research area. Topics may lead to new insights and lay the groundwork for future advances in the study of cell-cell communication and the aggregate behavior of cell ensembles in cancerous tissues. Examples could include the identification of biologically meaningful spatial patterns that are predictive of disease progression, the role of stromal components in directing tumor cell behaviors, the prognostic value of cell-cell interactions, or the role of spatial patterning for information transfer across cells in a tumor. </p>

<p>Publicly available single-cell, multi-modality data that may be used include, but are not limited to, the National Cancer Institutes Human Tumor Atlas Network, the National Institutes of Health Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP), and the Human Cell Atlas. 
</p>
            <h3>Who Should Apply</h3>
            <p>We encourage researchers and clinicians at all levels of seniority with diverse expertise across the continuum of cancer research and all areas of synthetic biology and complementary fields including, but not limited to: engineering, systems biology, chemistry, protein engineering, materials science, physics, genetics, microbiome, computational sciences, data science, mathematics, and cell biology to consider how your experience could help shape and transform the future of cancer research and biology-based technologies.</p>
            <p>Irrespective of expertise, we are most interested in new, innovative ideas and original thinking that arise from new collaborations between people of diverse backgrounds and varying expertise.</p>
            <p>Approximately 30 applicants will be selected to participate in the Innovation on the basis of the interests, expertise, and other characteristics solicited in the application. Most participants are expected to be academic faculty, from early career to senior investigators. Original thinkers from outside academia (e.g., industry) or earlier career stages are also encouraged to apply. When selecting participants, consideration will be given to balance across a range of diverse disciplinary experience and expertise. All participants should be willing to engage in frank disclosure and assessment of ideas in a collegial and professional fashion. To facilitate open sharing, all meeting discussions will be considered a private communication and not to be shared outside of the meeting, unless approved by the contributor. NIH staff, in consultation with the Jumpstart director, will review applications and select the final list of participants. All research-related application information will be kept confidential.</p>
            <h3>The Opportunity</h3>
            <p>Synthetic biology can advance research across cancer biology, prevention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment, and population science using engineered circuits, networks, and cells that can sense inputs, apply logic to determine a response to the inputs, and then initiate a response. Key opportunities to be explored span the continuum of cancer research including, but not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Cancer biology, such as synthetic cellular/molecular networks to model, probe, and perturb cancer signaling pathways in mammalian cells or biological tools to monitor and report spatiotemporal changes in pre-cancer and cancer cells in situ</li>
              <li>Cancer prevention, such as engineered biological sensors to safely identify cell exposure or damage in early cancer development in vivo and deliver approaches to prevent progression</li>
              <li>Cancer early detection and diagnosis, such as engineered biological components to safely identify and report short-lived, low-level, or other difficult to measure markers of disease in vivo</li>
              <li>Cancer therapeutics, such as engineered cells or microbes with in vivo targeted, controlled therapeutic delivery or therapeutic action</li>
              <li>Cancer population science, such as engineered systems for understanding the impact of genetic variation combined with environmental exposures (e.g. toxicants, lifestyle or dietary factors, chemical mixtures, hormones, etc.) on cancer etiology and susceptibility, including modeling impact of the timing of exposure (i.e. critical susceptibility windows, or cumulative exposures). </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Innovation Lab will facilitate collaborations between experimentalists, modelers, and cancer experts. This should lead to new approaches to study the fundamental mechanisms of cancer development, progression, or response to interventions and the development and evaluation of novel diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic strategies to human cancer.</p>
            <h3>Meeting Outcomes</h3>
            <p>New collaborative teams will form around promising research ideas and iteratively develop the concepts into realizable research projects. We encourage teams to develop applications for NIH funding opportunities and NIH staff are available to assist with identifying appropriate opportunities.</p>
            <h3>Why and How to Apply</h3>
