            <h2>We need your help to “hack” the Rules of Life - to consider how we might use those Rules to tackle pressing societal challenges.</h2>
            <p>The remarkable complexity of life is best revealed when interactions within and between levels of organization – from molecules to ecosystems – are considered. Indeed, Understanding Rules of Life requires working at multiple scales of biological organization and across multiple disciplines. Such a multi-scale, multi-discipline approach has been central to NSF’s Understanding the Rules of Life Big Idea.</p><p>We have a hunch that by better understanding and applying Rules of Life, we might be able to tackle some of the most pressing societal challenges. We invite you to help us explore the societal challenges that might be best addressed by applying what we have learned in Understanding the Rules of Life projects and then to identify the fundamental research that would be necessary to allow that work to happen.</p>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>In 2016, the National Science Foundation (NSF) unveiled a set of "Big Ideas," 10 bold, long-term research and process ideas that identified unique opportunities to position our Nation at the cutting edge of global science and engineering by bringing together diverse disciplinary perspectives to support convergence research. One of those, <b>Understanding the Rules of Life</b>, is based on developing a predictive understanding of how key properties of living systems emerge from interactions of factors such as genomes, phenotypes, and dynamic environments (See the link in the box to the right).</p> <p>As NSF considers ways to promote use-inspired research that reaches beyond curiosity-driven science, we seek multidisciplinary, community feedback on how researchers can <b>use the emerging Rules of Life to address <u>societal challenges</u></b> by combining approaches from among all the scientific disciplines, including engineering, mathematics, physical sciences, computer science, geosciences, social, behavioral, and economic sciences, as well as the breadth of biological sciences.</p>
        
<h3>About the Workshops</h3>
<p>To this end we announce a series of free Virtual Events centered on Using the Rules of Life to Address Societal Challenges.  The goal is to bring together diverse researchers from all scientific disciplines to share ideas about how Rules of Life approaches and data might be harnessed by multidisciplinary teams to tackle pressing societal challenges.</p><p>The events will include a Virtual Town Hall on March 15, 2022 for NSF to get community feedback on which grand challenges are best-suited to being solved by this convergent approach, as well as innovative ideas on how and what kinds of multidisciplinary teams can solve them. A subsequent series of four Virtual Workshops will be held on four separate days (April 14, 19, 21, and 26, 2022), each focused on a specific challenge defined by the Town Hall discussions.</p>


            <h3>Participation</h3>
            <p>We encourage scientists with all levels of experience, from senior researchers through postdocs, and from all branches of science to participate and contribute to the discussion. Principal investigators will have the opportunity to lend their scientific experience and vision to different ideas, and hear their own ideas augmented by other disciplinary perspectives.  Postdocs will have the opportunity to engage in specially tailored professional networking opportunities, and to join in the discussions with more established scientists.</p>
            <p>Everyone is welcome to join the Town Hall to help define the topics that we will explore in greater depth at the subsequent workshops - the more the merrier. We simply ask that you register here using the button below so that we can plan effectively.</p>
            <p>We do not know what the precise topics are likely to be for the workshops in April - that is to be guided by your discussions at the Town Hall on March 15th. This means that you cannot select the Workshop (or Workshops) you are most likely to be interested in until after that date. We invite you to hold all 4 dates in your calendar if possible.
