            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Human communities and economies are concentrated along the world’s coastlines. Yet ongoing climate change continues to drive complex interactions between geophysical and social-ecological systems that amplify environmental threats facing coastal communities and their economies. The Coastal Sustainability workshop leverages nature-based solutions as a framework to explore and shape the co-development of convergent research that is stakeholder-driven, inclusive, and focused on identifying and implementing sustainability solutions that promote clean, safe, smart, and equitable coastal communities. </p>

<p>More details on the four, virtual Workshop Session can be found below. In advance of each session, the Organizing Committee will provide prompts and background reading to prime the conversation.
.</p>
            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p>SSustaining human coastal communities is an urgent societal priority. While this urgency is driven by complex challenges, it also opens new doors of opportunity to (1) move away from entrenched and outdated perspectives on the relationship between people and nature and (2) co-develop solutions that are environmentally sound and socially equitable. Workshop participants will meet these challenges by embracing convergent research that integrates the expertise of geophysical, biological, cognitive and social scientists, and engineers, and fully co-develops strategies with diverse stakeholders and decision makers. 
</P>
<p>Nature-based solutions represent a potentially powerful path for mitigation of and adaptation to coastal threats and better methods of acknowledging the integration of people and nature. Yet many barriers have hindered the acceleration of their implementation. Such barriers include diverse human attitudes and perceptions; deeply seated cognitive assumptions and biases; outdated and bureaucratic policies; historical legacies of relying on built infrastructure to address coastal threats; limited appreciation of the co-benefits of nature-based solutions; inadequate engagement with stakeholders, especially those from systematically marginalized groups; and a failure to leverage convergent research for rapid solution development.</p>
<p>This convergence accelerator workshop will connect fundamental and translational scientists and engineers with stakeholders to co-develop knowledge, solutions and tools to enhance coastal sustainability. Our chief goal is to develop a transdisciplinary framework that identifies the interactions and “friction points” that have impeded implementation of nature-based solutions and forges new pathways that overcome these barriers.
</p>

<h3>The Workshop Sessions</h3>
            <p>Our workshop sessions will actively engage with diverse community organizations, government officials, and technical experts to ensure that conversations and resulting outputs are inclusive of all necessary voices. Such diverse groups outperform homogeneous groups of the best individual problem solvers, and they also strengthen scientific collaboration and creativity. By bringing together individuals and organizations from around the country that typically do not interact directly, our session will facilitate relationship building and partnerships that accelerate short-term solutions and extend beyond the Convergence Accelerator process, helping to advance the science and practice of coastal sustainability.</p>
<p><strong>The workshop will take place across four virtual sessions (all times EST):</strong></p>


<p>
A key aspect of promoting sustainable solutions is the communications strategy used to impart information and engage participation. Our workshop will be facilitated by the Knowinnovation (KI) group, who have extensive experience developing and running workshops, including several for NSF’s Convergence Accelerator program. </p>
<p>
Key features of the workshop will include interactive, co-development of ideas and promotion of diversity and inclusion across academic, industry, and stakeholder partners. Event design will focus on ideation, style of interaction, and specific outputs. KI promotes workshop formats where participants move around frequently across virtual rooms to ensure engagement with diverse and new perspectives that are driven by different kinds of stimulus. KI creates events that are participant-generated with ideas coming from the “front lines” of active members of the research, education, stakeholder and decision-making community. KI will work with the Organizing Committee and NSF to generate stimulating questions and mechanisms of output capture. A significant intention of KI’s interactive events is to build future collaborations, explore real ideas that people can move forward, promote community-building both during the event and after (e.g., establishing Slack channels and social media outlets that continue the engagement).</p>
<p>Both the Coastal Sustainability Institute and KI are dedicated to ensuring that broad constituencies have a voice at our workshop, with particular emphasis on stakeholders from systematically marginalized groups. Historically, efforts to promote coastal sustainability through nature-based solutions have primarily included individuals with privileged opportunity and educational background, with significant capital investment in businesses or property vulnerable to climate change, and/or with occupational incentives for dedicating their time. We will actively recruit individuals who work closely with stakeholders from systematically marginalized communities, including municipal individuals responsible for housing, water, waste management, and economic development. We will also work closely with community and social justice advocacy groups, and we will provide participant support costs to facilitate their participation.</p>


            <h3>Who Should Apply??</h3>
            <p>We should update this if we want an application. this is place holder text from a recent workshop: We encourage researchers and educators at the PI-level with diverse expertise across the continuum of wildfire research: biology (molecular to global scale), engineering, Earth science, physical science, social science, and computer science to consider how your experience could help to fundamentally transform our understanding of how strategic and convergent research could improve our understanding of how wildfires and living systems interact and forecast these dynamics in a warming world.</p>

<p>Irrespective of expertise, we are most interested in new, innovative ideas and original thinking that arise from new collaborations between people of diverse backgrounds and varying experience.</p>

<p>Approximately XX applicants will be selected to participate on the basis of the interests, expertise, and other characteristics solicited in the application. Most participants are expected to be academic faculty, from early career to senior investigators. Original thinkers from outside academia are also encouraged to apply. When selecting participants, consideration will be given to balance across a range of diverse disciplinary experience and expertise. All participants should be willing to engage in frank discussion and assessment of ideas in a collegial and professional fashion. To facilitate open sharing, all meeting discussions will be considered a private communication and not to be shared outside of the meeting, unless approved by the contributor. </p>
<p> At this time there are no funding opportunities associated with this lab, but opportunities for submission of project proposals across NSF and other federal agencies will be highlighted during the lab. This would be cool - let's ask Lara.

            <h3>Meeting Outcomes</h3>
            <p>This convergence accelerator workshop will focus on fundamental and translational science and engineering that collaborates with stakeholders to co-develop knowledge, solutions and tools. Recognizing that both scientific and societal barriers prevent their full realization, the workshop will leverage nature-based solutions as an overarching framework that seeks to promote convergence across four vertical and four horizontal themes (Figure 1). The verticals represent categories of nature-based solutions and the horizontals represent cross-cutting approaches needed to fully implement the verticals. The intersection of each of these horizontal and vertical themes – the nodes – represent pockets of opportunity amidst uncertainty in management approaches, the science driving them, and the stakeholder communities that will ultimately be impacted by potential sustainability solutions. We will do a deep dive with workshop participants to identify scientific priorities that include reversing and preventing the causes of impaired water quality (e.g., harmful algal blooms and hypoxia) and improving coastal infrastructure including new approaches to cope with threats posed by sea level rise and coastal storm surge. We also will focus on barriers to full realization by integrating the cognitive and social sciences to determine how human attitudes, beliefs, and preferences dictate the viability of sustainability solutions. A key point of emphasis will be promotion of equitable outcomes while optimizing the various trade-offs that exist between economic, social-ecological, geophysical drivers and their interaction with human attitudes, beliefs and preferences. Below we summarize the key themes and the primary people leading them.
