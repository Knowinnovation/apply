      To change the background image:
      1. Add new image to ../../images/ folder
      2. Open main.css
      3. Press Ctrl+F and search "banner"
      4. Replace "banner.jpg" with the new image name in the following:
            background-image: url('../../images/banner.jpg');
      Note: keep the ../../images/ if the new image is stored in the images folder

      OR change the background image by deleting "banner.jpg" in the images folder and then upload a new image titled "banner.jpg" to the same location.

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Given the increasing military, scientific, and commercial use of Earth orbital and cislunar space, as well as the inexorable desire of humans to explore farther regions of the solar system, the need for new materials that can withstand harsh space environments will continue unabated. However, the more distant destinations mean that our ability to be confident in decisions based on flight heritage data or to conduct flight testing of candidate spacecraft materials will become more limited. Thus, high-fidelity ground-based experimental and modeling efforts that can be used to guide materials design and predict performance will become ever more valuable. With numerous roadmaps to space and decadal surveys being proposed, little attention is being paid to the materials that will be required to function in relevant space environments. We must ensure that materials technology can meet future needs. A virtual workshop will gather experts from materials science, space environments effects, spacecraft engineering, and mission planning communities to identify current and future needs for materials that can perform their functions in various space environments and define materials research areas where investment is likely to have the greatest impact on future missions.</p>

            <h3> Challenge</h3>
            <p>The study of materials science, processing, and manufacturing has received a huge amount of attention and has been the subject of two recent workshops. On the other hand, materials research aimed at the development of space-durable materials in harsh space environments has languished. Given the increasing military, scientific, and commercial use of Earth orbital and cislunar space, as well as the inexorable desire of humans to explore regions of the solar system beyond Earth, the need for new materials that can withstand harsh space environments will continue unabated. However, the more distant destinations mean that our ability to be confident in decisions based on flight heritage data or to conduct flight testing of candidate spacecraft materials will become more limited. Thus, high-fidelity ground-based experimental and modeling efforts that can be used to guide materials design and predict performance will become ever more valuable. Not since the workshops that followed the return of Long Duration Exposure Facility 30 years ago have researchers from disparate materials science and space environmental effects communities attempted to identify areas of critical materials needs for future missions. With numerous roadmaps to space and decadal surveys being proposed, little attention is being paid to the materials that will be required to function in whatever environment might be relevant. Commensurate with our ability to dream up a future of human expansion into space, we must ensure that materials technology can meet future needs.</p>
