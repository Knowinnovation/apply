            <p>Applications will be accepted from [date] to [date].</p>
            <br>
          

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>CZI has launched two opportunities for collaborative teams bringing together patient-led rare disease organizations and research teams for 4-year research projects aimed at advancing our understanding of the fundamental science of rare diseases. Applications are being accepted for two funding opportunities:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Patient-partnered Collaborations for Rare Neurodegenerative Disease: to advance the understanding of the pathophysiology and mechanistic underpinnings of rare neurodegenerative and neurological disorders. Learn more about this RFA.</li>
              <li>Patient-partnered Collaborations for Single-Cell Analysis of Rare Inflammatory Pediatric Disease: to support the application of single-cell biology methods to rare inflammatory pediatric diseases that will clarify cellular mechanisms of disease, understand disease heterogeneity, and improve biomarkers or diagnostics. Learn More about this RFA</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Each of these RFAs recognizes patient-led organizations as central to defining research questions and priorities in their disease areas, connecting researchers to the patient community, contributing to study design, and engaging patients in research. For many rare and ultra-rare disorders, even when there is a diagnosis, the lack of understanding of disease biology is a critical bottleneck for developing treatments. Together, these RFAs aim to support patient-centered, foundational science-focused projects that seek to characterize the cellular mechanisms underlying rare diseases.</p>
            <p>While the first information session will cover both RFAs, for the engagement series (Microlabs and Expo), we will focus on the Patient-partnered Collaborations for Rare Neurodegenerative disease RFA to advance the understanding of the pathophysiology and mechanistic underpinnings of rare neurodegenerative and neurological disorders. This is a four-part series of events.</p>
            <br>
            

            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p>CZI recognizes that researchers and patient groups don’t always know how to find each other. This series of networking events and workshops aims to catalyze new collaborations between patient research organizations and researchers and to bring together existing teams interested in applying to the Patient-partnered Collaborations for Rare Neurodegenerative Disease RFA.</p>
            <br>
          

            <h3>What will Microlabs and Expo sessions be like?</h3>
            <p>A significant goal of this interactive format is to set up collaborations, explore real ideas that people can move forward, and promote community-building both during the event and after. All events will be hosted virtually and include an online web platform where participants can register, find one another and network with each other. Live sessions will be held using the Zoom platform. Main sessions will be recorded and made available on this website for anyone interested to view them after the event. Discussion sessions will not be shared publicly.</p>
            <p><strong>Microlabs</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The two 120-minute Microlabs are intended to bring patient groups and researchers together.</li>
              <li>Participants will hear examples of what successful patient-partnered research collaborations might look like, how to maintain successful partnerships, and what key factors can contribute to success</li>
              <li>Participants will engage with each other, meet in small groups, and share their perspective on how to expand the understanding of the underpinnings of rare neurodegenerative disease and how to channel the focus of research efforts towards issues and questions that are critically relevant to the patient experience</li>
              <li>Prior application is required, and participants will be selected based on their application</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Expo</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The two-day Expo is intended to provide opportunities for networking and ideating for patient advocates without a research partner and for researchers interested in partnering with patient groups</li>
              <li>It is explicitly meant for those considering applying to the Patient-partnered Collaborations for Rare Neurodegenerative Disease RFA</li>
              <li>Participants will interactively co-develop ideas through facilitated interactions with diverse individuals across disciplines, backgrounds, and perspectives</li>
              <li>Prior application is required, and participants will be selected based on their application</li>
              <li>Commitment to participating in both Expo days is required</li>
            </ul>
            <br>


            <h3>Community Participation Guidelines</h3>
            <p>CZI is committed to creating and maintaining an environment where everyone is welcomed, respected, and supported. We want our grantees and partners to have an opportunity to participate and contribute, and to be valued for their skills, experience, and unique perspectives. As such, we have created Community Participation Guidelines and expect all those who participate in CZI communities to hold themselves accountable to them — whether participating in a meeting, convening, workshop, online discussion, or other forum. You can find these guidelines at <a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/ethics-policies/community-participation-guidelines/" target="_blank">czi.co/CPG.</a></p>

            <h3>Who Should Attend This Series?</h3>
            <p>The initial Information Session is open to anyone, but registration is required. Additional opportunities past this session are for people/groups that do not currently have or are seeking additional possible research networks that CZI might one day support. We encourage anyone looking to form a research team in preparation for the PPC for Rare Neurodegenerative Disease RFA to register, particularly researchers and patient advocates in rare neurological disease fields. For RFA eligibility, see the announcement here. The following is a list of some, but not all, of the potentially relevant fields:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>XX</li>
              <li>YY</li>
              <li>ZZ</li>
              <li>AA</li>
              <li>BB</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We encourage participants from all levels of experience from students/trainees through early and mid-career folks to senior and retired participants. Irrespective of expertise, we are most interested in new, innovative ideas and original thinking that arise from new collaborations between people of diverse backgrounds and varying experience.</p>
            <p>We have room for up to 500 people in Session 1, for up to [xx] people in the Microlabs, and for up to [xx] people in the two-day Expo. If more folks than that express interest by registering, we will need to select participants. When doing so, consideration will be given to balance across a range of diverse disciplinary experience and expertise. All participants should be willing to engage in frank discussion and assessment of ideas in a collegial and professional fashion (see Community Participation Guidelines above). </p>
