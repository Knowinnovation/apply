            <h2>Hi Postdocs!<p>If you have clicked on this page we assume that you are interested in applying to attend one of the URoL Workshops after the Town Hall on March 15.</p></h2>
            <p>Everyone is invited to attend the Town Hall on March 15. Sadly, we have limited space at the subsequent URoL Workshops where we will explore in more detail some of the themes identified at the Town Hall in greater detail. We anticipate accepting about 25 postdocs to attend each URoL workshop. That acceptance comes with an expectation, as well as an invitation, for you to participate in a set of <b>three additional "Incubators"</b> designed to make your participation in the Workshops as productive and fulfilling as possible.</p>

            <h3>What are the objectives for these Incubators?</h3>
            <p><b>FIRST</b> To prepare you for your role at the URoL workshop you’ll attend.<p>What role I hear you say? So glad you asked.<p>We ask that you work as part of a team to produce some output from the meeting. It could be a research project with other postdocs and PI´s, it could be a paper on a topic related to the URoL workshop, it could be advice to the community and NSF on how to involve postdocs, or you might decide to join the writing team with PI´s who are producing papers from the URoL workshops. The slate of options is very open.</p><p><b>SECOND</b> It will be an opportunity to network with other postdocs who have an interest in and are working on cool science in domains in which you are also interested.</p><p><b>THIRD</b> It will give you time and space to reflect on the collaborative, cross-disciplinary and use inspired research future of your own career.</p>
        
<h3>About the Incubators</h3>
<p><b>"Book-end" Incubators</b>: Two incubators (each about 4 hours long) will "book-end" the workshops. The first kick-off incubator will be on April 12th just following the short URoL Orientation meeting. The second, wrap-up incubator will be a closing workshop for Postdocs only, scheduled for May 17th. This one will especially emphasize reflection and networking.</p>


            <h3>Project/Paper writing Incubators</h3>
            <p>There will attend one of two project/paper writing Incubators (about 4 hours long). Which one will depend on which URoL workshop you attend; they are scheduled for April 22nd (for attendees of Workshops 1 and 2) and May 2nd (for attendees of Workshops 3 and 4).</p>
            <p>We invite you to hold all 4 Incubator dates in your calendar if possible.</p>
            <h3>Register for the Town Hall</h3>
            <p>All of you are welcome to join the Town Hall to help define the topics that we will explore in greater depth at the subsequent workshops - the more the merrier. If you haven't done so already, we simply ask that you register here using the button below so that we can plan effectively. After the Town Hall we will invite you to apply to participate in the Workshops. Space limitations mean that we can only accept a maximum of 25 Postdoc participants per workshop. We will share details about the application process the week after the Town Hall.</p>
