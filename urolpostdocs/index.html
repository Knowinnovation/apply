            <h2>Hi Post Doc!<p>If you are clicking on this page you are interested in perhaps applying to attend one of the URoL Workshops after the Town Hall on March 15th.</p></h2>
            <p>Here is a little preliminary information to give you some context. We anticipate accepting about 25 postdocs to attend each URoL workshop. The acceptance comes with an expectation as well as an invitation to a set of additional "Incubators" designed for postdocs. The additional Incubators have a couple of objectives.</p>

              <h3>Key Dates (highlighted in bold)</h3>
              <ul>
              <li>Town Hall: March 15, 11:00 to 14:30 EST</li>

            <h3>What are the objectives for these Incubators?</h3>
            <p><b>FIRST</b> To prepare you for your role at the URoL workshop you’ll attend.<p>What role I hear you say? So glad you asked.<p>There is an expectation that you will work on a team to produce some output from the meeting. It could be a research project with other postdocs and PI´s, it could be a paper on a topic related to the URoL workshop, it could be advice to the community and NSF on how to involve postdocs, you might decide to join the writing team with PI´s who are producing papers from the URoL workshops. The slate of options is very open.</p><p><b>SECOND</b> It will be an opportunity to network with other postdocs who have an interest in and are working on cool science in domains in which you are also interested.</p><p><b>THIRD</b> It will give you time and space to reflect on the collaborative, cross disciplinary and use inspired research future of your own career.</p>
        
<h3>About the Incubators</h3>
<p>To that end we will have two booked Incubators, each about 4 or so hours long with the full community of postdocs attending the four URoL workshops.</p><p>The first is on April 12th just on the heels of the short URoL Orientation meeting.</p><p>The final workshop is a closing workshop for postdocs scheduled for May 17th. (This one will especially lean in to reflection and networking.)</p>


            <h3>Project/Paper writing Incubators</h3>
            <p>There will also be two (four hour or so) project/paper writing Incubators. You’ll just attend one of those depending on which URoL workshop you attend. They are scheduled for April 22nd and May 2nd.</p>
            <p>We invite you to hold all 4 dates in your calendar if possible.</p>
            <h3>Register for the Town Hall</h3>
            <p>All of you are welcome to join the Town Hall to help define the topics that we will explore in greater depth at the subsequent workshops - the more the merrier. If you haven't done so already, we simply ask that you register here using the button below so that we can plan effectively. After the Town Hall we will invite you to apply to participate in the Workshops - sadly there is limited space and we cannot accept up to 25 Post Doc participants. We will share details about the application process in due course.</p>
