            <h2>Hi postdocs!<p>Thank you for your interest in attending one of the URoL Workshops after the Town Hall on March 15.</p></h2>
            <p>Everyone is invited to attend the Town Hall on March 15. Sadly, we have limited space for both postdocs and senior personnel at the subsequent URoL Workshops where we will explore some of the themes identified at the Town Hall in greater detail. We anticipate accepting about 25 postdocs to attend each of the 4 URoL workshops for a total of 100 postdocs. Your acceptance comes with an expectation that you will participate in a set of <b>three additional "Incubators"</b> which are designed to make your participation in the Workshops as productive and fulfilling as possible.</p><p>Please mark all dates below in your calendar for now. Once you are accepted to a URoL workshop, you can release the other URoL Workshop and Writing Incubator dates.</p>

            <h3>What are the objectives for these Incubators?</h3>
            <p><b>FIRST</b> - To prepare you for your role at the URoL workshop.</p><p><b>SECOND</b> - To network with other postdocs who have an interest in and are working on cool science in domains in which you are also interested.</p><p><b>THIRD</b> - To give you time and space to reflect on the collaborative, cross-disciplinary and use-inspired research future of your own career.</p>
        
<h2>About the Incubators</h2>
<h3>Kick-off Incubator</h3>
<p>The kick-off incubator will be on April 12 following the URoL Workshop Orientation. We will use break-out sessions with smaller groups of postdocs that focus on some framing questions on the challenges of cross-disciplinary, use-inspired research (goals, roles, opportunities, needs, etc.). In addition, your group will brainstorm potential topics for papers (see below).</p>


            <h3>Writing Incubators</h3>
            <p>Your team will attend one of two Writing Incubators. Which one will depend on which URoL workshop you attend; they are scheduled for April 22nd (for attendees of Workshops 1 and 2) and May 2nd (for attendees of Workshops 3 and 4).</p><p>Your team is expected to produce a paper from the Workshop and Incubator activities. The output will be decided by your group.  Possibilities include an outline of a research project or conference or conference session; a paper (potentially for publication) on a scientific topic related to the URoL workshop; a paper giving advice to the community and NSF on how to involve postdocs in the different stages of cross-disciplinary research. These are not limiting â€“ decide what is best for you and your group.</p>
            <h3>Wrap-up Incubator</h3>
            <p>This incubator provides an opportunity for you to meet and learn about the activities of postdocs who participated in the other three URoL Workshops. There will also be some activities to help you envision your research career and strategies over the next 10+ years.</p>
            <h3>Register for the Town Hall</h3>
            <p>All of you are welcome to join the March 15 Town Hall to help define the topics that we will explore in greater depth at the subsequent workshops. Please register here (using the button below) so that we can plan effectively.</p>
            <p><a class="button special" href="https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/35b58b3105a94383a48c30444be2568a" target="_blank">Register NOW for the Town Hall &gt;&gt;</a></p>
            <p>After the Town Hall we will invite you to apply to participate in the Workshops. Space limitation mean that we can only accept a maximum of 25 postdoc participants per workshop - for this reason the workshop application will ask you to identify your first and second choice workshop topics. We will share details about the application process the week after the Town Hall.</p>
